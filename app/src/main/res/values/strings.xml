        <b>What is RMS?</b> \n
        A software that translates RSA codes into human-readable text.

        \n \n <b>How does this program fundamentally work?</b>\n
        Messages are encrypted with  public key and decrypted by the recipient using a private key. \n \n
        In this program, you need to add the public key of the person you want to send a message to, choose a name for the key, and when you want to send a message, enter the name of the recipients public key. \n
        "You can scan the Qrcode of the public key and easily have the other partys key. Please note that this is a public key, and sharing it does not cause any issues." \n

        \n \n <b>Is it possible for the password to be hacked?</b> \n
        Yes, but the time required for this is more than a few months. \n

        With quantum computers, of which only a few exist, these types of codes can be obtained in less than a few minutes.
